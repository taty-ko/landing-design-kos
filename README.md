1. Create the landing page with adaptive design, using the @media.
2. The Landing consists of Header - Content - Footer Blocks.
3. Content Block: 
 - Use "absolute" for creating video blocks.
 - Use pictures instead of swipers items.
4. Fix the Footer at the end of the page. If the Content Block has no content, the Footer should be pinned at the end of the Screen.
